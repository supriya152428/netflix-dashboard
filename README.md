# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis – Power BI Project

This is a complete Power BI dashboard that analyzes Netflix's content library. It includes visual insights on movie and TV show distribution, release trends over time, popular genres, total runtime, and country-wise content spread. This project was built to practice Power BI tools, DAX functions, and interactive dashboard design.

## ⚙️ Features and Functions Used

This project helped me understand and apply core Power BI functionalities:

### 🧩 Visual Elements:
- **Card Visuals** – For metrics like total runtime, content count, number of movies/shows, and average IMDb rating
- **Bar Chart** – Displaying top genres for both movies and shows
- **Line Chart** – Tracking total content growth over time
- **Donut Chart** – Showing content type proportions
- **Map Visual** – Representing global content distribution

### 🎛️ Interactivity:
- **Slicers** to filter by:
  - Year of release
  - Title
  - Genre

### 🧮 DAX Functions:
- `SUM()` – To calculate total runtime
- `COUNTROWS()` – To count entries
- `CALCULATE()` – For filtered measures (e.g., only Movies or Shows)
- `AVERAGE()` – For IMDb ratings
- Likely used `TOPN()` or `RANKX()` for sorting genres

### 🎨 Design Approach:
- Dark-themed layout with red Netflix branding
- Organized visuals for clarity and storytelling
- Simplified filters for easy exploration
